### Method Goals


This method aims to return all the available options for a given date
and itinerary. It does not filter different classes, times or fares. It
will always return all of the results returned by the provider.



### Request Format


The common part of an availability request is very straight forward. It
only requires the destination/s, the travelling dates, the paxes and the
indication of the trip type: one way trip or a round trip.



### Response Format


The response format will always be delivered in the node Transportation,
which will be organized by two main nodes:

-   Segments:

A list with all of the Segments including details, returned by the
supplier, such as dates, number, etc.



-   Fares:

A list with all of the prices returned for each Segment in the above
list. Each Fare has a referenced SegmentReference inside the node
Option, to identify the Segment. A Fare will have one or more Segments
associated and every Segment will refer to at least one Option.

There will always be one PaxBreakdown per passenger type.

The price returned is "all inclusive". All fares, taxes and discounts
are already included in the total price.



### Remarks


This method **must** be called **before** the Valuation method.

The maximum time that our systems permits before closing the connexion
is of **25000** milliseconds.

### Detailed description


**Total amount breakdown:**

The totalAmount from AmountBreakdown can be calculated by simply adding
the prices of each amount attribute from every PaxBreakdown.

Please note, that the amount as already had in consideration the taxes,
therefore, if the total price marks a 100€, and the taxes are 10€, then
the base price is 90€, like so:

  Pax Breakdown:

 Adult     |      Amount: 100€      |   tax: 10€

Total amount: 100€ Tax: 10€ Pax amount: 100€ - 10€ = 90€



**How to calculate a breakdown:**

Lets say for example we want to calculate the breakdown of the paxes,
then the amount will be the sum of all of the paxes price multiplied by
the number paxes.

For example, if the prices for each pax type are:

Paxes breakdown:                             

| Adult       |  Amount: 100€     |    tax: 10€  |
| Child       |  Amount: 50€      |    tax: 10€  |
| Infant      |  Amount: 10€      |    tax: 10€  |

And we want to do a booking for two adults, two kids and one baby, the
configuration of the paxes will be:


Paxes configuration:                        

| Adult    |    Attribute   |   Bonus  |
| Adult    |    Attribute   |   Bonus  |
| Child    |    Attribute   |   Bonus  |
| Child    |    Attribute   |   Bonus  |
| Infant   |    Attribute   |   Bonus  |

Therefore the total price will be:


Amount breakdown:

| Total  |  Amount: (DesgloseADT \* numADT) + (DesgloseCHD \* numCHD) + (DesgloseINF \* numINF) = **310€**
